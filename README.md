## Projects

### Practice Typer
This web project used HTML/CSS, Vanilla JS and Flask for it's development. In this business case, me and my college teamate, wanted to create a space were MLH's students could practice their retyping skill for coding in the most popular programming languages, while there is no summer coding programs.

### NFA Lambda (Automaton)
The project is a C++ program that simulates a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) with Lambda transitions. The program is able to read an automaton from a text file and then try different inputs on it. The user can create the automaton by providing the transitions, states, and acceptance states. 

### Instagram Filter simulator
In this project, we wanted to process different colored images in a special format called bmp (windows bitmap), a type of file that contains a map of bits or in simpler terms a matrix of bits, and convert it into different types of image (for example, grayscale or sepia), using a functional language like Elixir.

### HeroQuest
The goal of HeroQuest is to generate a community of Dungeons and Dragons players, in which each user can customize their games and create infinite games, giving free rein to their imagination, and coexisting with other players remotely through the platform.

### SideQuest
SideQuest is a web platform for playing the famous role playing game called "Dungeons & Dragons" or better known as D&D or DnD. The purpose of the proyect was to make an online experience of the famous game and to take advantage of different web services to create a more diverse game, speccially in characters and heroes creation. In this specific project, my task was to add Redis for user login cache.

### Vuforia AR
On my abroad semester in Spain, we had to make an AR app that was capable of recognizing images and making a ball path simulation.

### Horror VR
An interactive horror video in which the user, through virtual reality lenses, can move their field of view, along with audio.

### Bolo Live
Created a prototype, in 24 hours, of an App in Java and Unity for a retail company to solved a business problem. The prototype had an AR Unity interface that recognized the logo of the company and showed a figure related to the company.

### Distribution in a web of nodes
This project consist on a simulation of the distribution of work in a network of distributed nodes, based on a multiprocessor/multicore system in which the processes are solved in NxM matrices. The main objective was to make the simulation an animation and using parallel programming.

### Contact List App
This repository is an app for practicing and learning NativeScript written with Angular and Typescript, where you can add and erase contacts, within a personal profile (user login and sign up).
